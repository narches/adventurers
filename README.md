# **ADVENTURERS**

# **Overview**

Adventurers is a simple text-based adventure game software that was created with C# with the aim to bring tasks adventurous experience to gamers . 
The purpose of this program is to make create an experience of fun and immersive entertainment for players. The player who acts as the leader of a team of adventurers,
makes decisions at different stages of the story that impact the outcome of the game. The choices made by the player determine whether the adventurers successfully 
navigate challenges and ultimately become wonderful adventurers.

# **Development Environment**

* Microsoft Visual Studio Studio
* C-Sharp (C#)
* .NET Frameworks
* Git/GitHub

The development of the Adventurers software involved the use of C#, ensuring a seamless and efficient creation process. 
Here's a brief overview of the primary tool employed in crafting this sophisticated financial tool:

##### CSHARP (C#):
C# (C-Sharp) is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework
It is used to develop web apps, desktop apps and mobile apps, games and much more.
It's fundamentally object-oriented and component-focused, supporting the creation and utilization of software components seamlessly. 
Offering features like garbage collection, nullable types, robust exception handling, 
lambda expressions, LINQ, asynchronous operations, a unified type system, and both reference and value types, 
C# promotes consistent operations across types. Moreover, it supports generic methods, iterators, 
and emphasizes versioning for evolution while ensuring compatibility, seen in aspects like separate virtual 
and override modifiers, method overload resolution rules, and explicit interface member declarations.
